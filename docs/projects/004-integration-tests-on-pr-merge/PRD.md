# Project 004: Integration Tests on Pull Request Merge

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing strategy and CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions when pull requests are merged into the main branch.

**GitHub Issues**: 
- [#108 - integration tests on pull request merge](https://github.com/cbnsndwch/n8n-nodes-luma/issues/108)
- [#112 - Add Workflow File for Testing PRs](https://github.com/cbnsndwch/n8n-nodes-luma/issues/112)

## Problem Statement

As a maintainer of this repository, I would like a battery of unit and integration tests to be run when a pull request is ready to be merged or merged, so that I can have confidence that the changes work as expected and don't break existing functionality.

## Objectives

- Implement automated testing on pull request events
- Ensure code quality and prevent regressions
- Provide fast feedback to contributors
- Maintain confidence in the codebase integrity
- Follow best practices for CI/CD in open-source projects

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests are written and run with vitest
- The test suite contains a variety of tests:
  - **Unit tests** for self-contained features
  - **Workflow execution tests** that check that changes to nodes don't break the rules of n8n workflows
  - **Frontend tests** to verify that the user experience when building workflows that include the nodes in this repo is good
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs tests on pull requests and merges
- All quality gates must pass before code can be merged

## Technical Implementation

### Testing Framework

**Vitest Configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`):
- Uses vitest as the test runner for performance and TypeScript support
- Configures test environment and setup files
- Includes coverage reporting capabilities
- Supports multiple test categories (unit, integration, frontend)

### Test Suite Structure

The comprehensive test suite includes 55+ tests across three categories:

#### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
**Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- Build system validation
- Source file verification
- Operations testing for each resource (calendar, event, guest, ticket, user, utility)
- Configuration and setup testing

#### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
**Purpose**: Test n8n workflow execution and node registration
- Node registration with n8n
- Workflow execution validation
- Parameter handling and validation
- Error scenario testing
- API integration testing

#### 3. Frontend/UX Tests (`tests/frontend/`)
**Purpose**: Validate user experience and UI behavior
- Node properties validation
- Parameter structure testing
- Conditional field display
- User-friendly configuration validation

### CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):

```yaml
name: Test Suite

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [22.x]
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        
    - name: Install pnpm
      uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      with:
        package_json_file: './package.json'
        
    - name: Setup pnpm cache
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: ${{ env.STORE_PATH }}
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      
    - name: Build project
      run: pnpm run build
      
    - name: Run linter
      run: pnpm run lint
      
    - name: Check code formatting
      run: pnpm exec prettier nodes credentials --check
      
    - name: Run test suite
      run: pnpm run test:run
```

### Quality Gates

The CI pipeline enforces the following quality gates:

1. **Dependency Installation**: Ensures all dependencies install correctly
2. **Build Validation**: TypeScript compilation must succeed
3. **Code Linting**: ESLint rules must pass
4. **Code Formatting**: Prettier formatting must be consistent
5. **Test Suite**: All unit, integration, and frontend tests must pass

### Test Commands

**Package.json Scripts**:
```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:unit": "vitest run tests/unit",
  "test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration", 
  "test:frontend": "vitest run tests/frontend"
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Configure vitest test runner
- ✅ Set up test directory structure
- ✅ Create test utilities and helpers
- ✅ Implement test setup and teardown

### Phase 2: Test Suite Development
- ✅ Write unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Implement integration tests for workflow execution
- ✅ Create frontend tests for user experience
- ✅ Achieve comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Configure automated testing on PR events
- ✅ Set up caching for dependencies
- ✅ Implement quality gates and validation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Maintenance
