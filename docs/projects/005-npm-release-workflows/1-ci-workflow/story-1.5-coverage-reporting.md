# [PROJ_005] Story 1.5: Coverage Reporting

**Epic:** Continuous Integration Setup  
**Story ID:** 1.5  
**Priority:** Medium  

## User Story
**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want to** have test coverage analysis and reporting integrated into CI  
**So that** I can monitor code coverage trends and ensure adequate test coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Test coverage data is generated during CI test execution
- ✅ Coverage reports are uploaded to external service (Codecov)
- ✅ Coverage status is visible in GitHub PR interface
- ✅ Coverage trends are tracked over time
- ✅ Coverage thresholds can be configured and enforced
- ✅ Clear coverage breakdown by file and function
- ✅ Integration with existing vitest test runner

## Technical Implementation
```yaml
# Addition to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: pnpm run test:coverage

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    file: ./coverage/lcov.info
    flags: unittests
    name: codecov-umbrella
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

## Coverage Configuration
### Vitest Coverage Setup
```javascript
// vitest.config.ts enhancement
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html', 'lcov'],
      exclude: [
        'node_modules/**',
        'dist/**',
        'tests/**',
        '**/*.d.ts',
        'gulpfile.js',
        '.eslintrc*.js'
      ],
      thresholds: {
        global: {
          branches: 80,
          functions: 80,
          lines: 80,
          statements: 80
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Coverage Targets
### Current Test Coverage Areas
- **Unit Tests**: Build system, source file validation, operations
- **Integration Tests**: Node registration, workflow execution, API integration
- **Frontend Tests**: User experience, node properties, parameter validation

### Coverage Goals
- **Lines**: >80% line coverage
- **Functions**: >80% function coverage
- **Branches**: >80% branch coverage
- **Statements**: >80% statement coverage

## Coverage Reporting Structure
```
coverage/
├── lcov.info          # LCOV format for Codecov
├── coverage-final.json # JSON format for programmatic access
├── html/              # HTML reports for local viewing
│   ├── index.html     # Coverage summary
│   └── [source files] # File-specific coverage
└── text-summary.txt   # Console output summary
```

## Test Cases
- Coverage data is generated correctly for all test types
- Coverage reports include all source files
- Excluded files (tests, config) are properly ignored
- Coverage thresholds are enforced when configured
- Codecov integration uploads data successfully
- PR comments show coverage changes
- Coverage trends are visible over time

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test coverage is generated during CI execution
- [ ] Coverage data is uploaded to Codecov successfully
- [ ] Coverage status appears in GitHub PR checks
- [ ] Coverage reports are accessible and accurate
- [ ] Coverage thresholds are configured appropriately
- [ ] Coverage trends can be monitored over time
- [ ] Integration with existing test suite works seamlessly
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<30 seconds additional time)

## Dependencies
- **Story 1.2**: Test execution integration must be complete
- **Codecov Account**: Service account setup for coverage reporting
- **GitHub Secrets**: CODECOV_TOKEN configured in repository settings
- **Vitest Configuration**: Coverage configuration in vitest.config.ts

## Codecov Integration
### Service Setup
1. **Account Creation**: Codecov account linked to GitHub repository
2. **Token Generation**: Repository-specific token for uploads
3. **GitHub Secret**: CODECOV_TOKEN stored securely
4. **PR Integration**: Automatic PR comments with coverage changes

### Coverage Analysis Features
- **File-level Coverage**: Line-by-line coverage visualization
- **PR Comparisons**: Coverage changes between base and PR branches
- **Trend Analysis**: Coverage changes over time
- **Team Notifications**: Coverage drop alerts

## Performance Considerations
### Coverage Generation Impact
- **Test Execution Time**: Coverage adds ~20-30% to test time
- **CI Pipeline**: Total additional time <30 seconds
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal additional memory/CPU requirements
- **Artifact Size**: Coverage files are relatively small

### Optimization Strategies
- **Selective Coverage**: Only generate coverage for source files
- **Efficient Reporters**: Use optimal reporter combination
- **Parallel Processing**: Coverage generation can run with tests
- **Caching**: Consider coverage result caching for unchanged code

## Error Handling
### Coverage Generation Failures
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: pnpm run test:coverage
  continue-on-error: false  # Fail CI if coverage fails

- name: Upload coverage (allow failure)
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  continue-on-error: true   # Don't fail CI if upload fails
```

### Upload Failures
- Network issues with Codecov service
- Invalid token or authentication problems
- Malformed coverage data
- Service downtime or rate limiting

## Security Considerations
- **Token Protection**: CODECOV_TOKEN stored as GitHub Secret
- **Data Privacy**: Coverage data doesn't contain sensitive code details
- **Service Access**: Limited to coverage data upload only
- **Token Rotation**: Regular token rotation for security

## Validation Plan
### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Set up Codecov account and repository integration
- [ ] Configure CODECOV_TOKEN in GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Test coverage generation locally with vitest
- [ ] Verify coverage accuracy with sample code changes

### Implementation Testing
- [ ] Test successful coverage generation and upload
- [ ] Test coverage upload failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify PR integration and status checks
- [ ] Validate coverage threshold enforcement
- [ ] Test coverage comparison between branches

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Monitor coverage upload reliability
- [ ] Track coverage trends and team usage
- [ ] Verify performance impact on CI pipeline
- [ ] Gather team feedback on coverage insights

## Coverage Insights
### Actionable Metrics
- **Uncovered Lines**: Specific lines needing test coverage
- **Coverage Trends**: Whether coverage is improving or declining
- **File Hotspots**: Files with consistently low coverage
- **PR Impact**: How each PR affects overall coverage

### Team Benefits
- **Quality Visibility**: Clear view of test coverage quality
- **Technical Debt**: Identify areas needing more tests
- **Review Process**: Coverage changes visible during PR review
- **Continuous Improvement**: Encourage better testing practices

## Expected CI Output
```
✓ Tests with coverage: 55/55 passing
✓ Coverage generated: 
  - Lines: 87.5% (target: 80%)
  - Functions: 92.1% (target: 80%)  
  - Branches: 85.3% (target: 80%)
  - Statements: 88.7% (target: 80%)
✓ Coverage uploaded to Codecov
✓ Coverage reporting: ~25 seconds
```

## Future Enhancements
### Advanced Coverage Features
- **Differential Coverage**: Focus on changed lines only
- **Coverage Comments**: Automated PR comments with details
- **Badge Integration**: README coverage badges
- **Advanced Thresholds**: Per-file or per-directory thresholds

### Integration Opportunities
- **Local Development**: Coverage-guided development workflows
- **Quality Gates**: Block merges below coverage thresholds
- **Reporting**: Regular coverage reports to team
- **Analytics**: Coverage trend analysis and insights

## Estimated Effort
