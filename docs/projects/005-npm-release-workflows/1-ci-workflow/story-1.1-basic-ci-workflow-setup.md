# [PROJ_005] Story 1.1: Basic CI Workflow Setup

**Epic:** Continuous Integration Setup  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Priority:** High  

## User Story
**As a** repository maintainer  
**I want to** have a GitHub Actions CI workflow that automatically runs on PRs and main branch pushes  
**So that** code quality is validated before merging and the main branch state is continuously verified

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow file created in `.github/workflows/`
- ✅ Workflow triggers on pull requests to any branch
- ✅ Workflow triggers on pushes to main branch
- ✅ Workflow includes proper Node.js and pnpm environment setup
- ✅ Workflow includes dependency caching for performance
- ✅ Workflow structure is ready for additional steps in subsequent stories
- ✅ Clear workflow naming and documentation

## Technical Implementation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ['*']
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: latest
          
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.pnpm-store
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-
            
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
        
      # Additional steps will be added in subsequent stories
```

## File Structure
```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml  # Main CI workflow file
```

## Environment Configuration
- **Node.js Version**: 22 (matching development requirements)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (latest stable version)
- **Operating System**: ubuntu-latest (GitHub Actions standard)
- **Dependency Caching**: pnpm store cache for performance

## Test Cases
- Workflow triggers when PR is opened/updated
- Workflow triggers when commits are pushed to main
- Node.js 22 is properly installed and available
- pnpm is installed and functional
- Dependencies are cached and restored correctly
- Workflow setup steps complete without errors

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI workflow file created and committed
- [ ] Workflow triggers properly on PRs and main pushes
- [ ] Node.js 22 environment is available in workflow
- [ ] pnpm is properly installed and configured
- [ ] Dependency caching is working and improves performance
- [ ] Workflow shows up in GitHub Actions tab
- [ ] Basic workflow structure is documented
- [ ] No errors in workflow setup steps

## Dependencies
- None (foundational story)

## Notes
- This workflow establishes the foundation for all subsequent CI steps
- Performance optimization through caching is included from the start
- Workflow structure is designed to be easily extended
- Node.js version matches development environment requirements

## Security Considerations
- Workflow uses only trusted marketplace actions
- No secrets required for basic setup
- Minimal permissions needed for checkout and caching

## Performance Expectations
- Initial setup (without cache): ~2-3 minutes
- Subsequent runs (with cache): ~30-60 seconds for setup
- Cache hit rate target: >80% after initial implementation

## Estimated Effort
**Story Points:** 2  
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours
