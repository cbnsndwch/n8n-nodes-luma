## üìã Epic Dependencies and Flow

```
Epic 1 (CI Setup)
    ‚Üì
Epic 2 (Release Automation) ‚Üê depends on Epic 1 workflows
    ‚Üì  
Epic 3 (Version Management) ‚Üê depends on Epic 2 publishing
```

**Sequential Implementation Required**: Each epic builds upon the previous one's infrastructure.

## üöÄ Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Epic 1) - Week 1
- **Goal**: Establish CI workflow for PR validation
- **Deliverables**: Working CI pipeline, test reporting, build validation
- **Success Criteria**: All PRs automatically validated with clear status reporting

### Phase 2: Automation (Epic 2) - Week 2  
- **Goal**: Enable automated npm publishing
- **Deliverables**: Release workflow, npm integration, security setup
- **Success Criteria**: GitHub releases automatically publish to npm registry

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Epic 3) - Week 3
- **Goal**: Complete version management automation  
- **Deliverables**: Version bumping, tagging, changelog generation
- **Success Criteria**: Fully automated release process with minimal manual intervention

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors

### Security Requirements
- **npm Token Protection**: Secure storage and usage in workflows
- **Permission Minimization**: Least-privilege access for all workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all automated actions

### Quality Assurance
- **100% Test Execution**: All 55 existing tests must pass in CI
- **Build Validation**: Complete TypeScript compilation and lint validation
- **Package Integrity**: Verification of dist/ contents before publishing

### Developer Experience
- **Fast Feedback**: CI results in <3 minutes
- **Clear Status**: Unambiguous pass/fail reporting
- **Easy Rollback**: Simple process for emergency rollbacks

## üìä Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas
1. **npm Token Security**: Use repository secrets with limited scope
2. **Build System Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
3. **Automated Publishing**: Implement comprehensive pre-publish validation

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **GitHub Actions Limits**: Monitor workflow execution time and frequency
2. **Dependency Changes**: Version pinning for critical workflow dependencies
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery procedures

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **Documentation Maintenance**: Automated documentation updates where possible
2. **Performance Impact**: Minimal impact on existing development workflow
3. **Feature Expansion**: Designed for future enhancement and scaling
