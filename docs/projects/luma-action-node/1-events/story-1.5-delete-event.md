**Epic:** Core Event Management  
**Story ID:** 1.5  
**Priority:** Low  

## User Story
**As a** workflow developer  
**I want to** remove events that are no longer needed  
**So that** I can maintain clean event listings

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Support event ID identification
- ✅ Confirm deletion with success response
- ✅ Handle attempts to delete non-existent events
- ✅ Consider cascading effects (guests, tickets, etc.)
- ✅ Support soft delete vs hard delete options

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Resource: Event
// Operation: Delete
// Parameters:
{
  eventId: string (required),
  additionalFields: {
    force?: boolean // hard delete vs soft delete
  }
}
```

## API Endpoint
- `POST /v1/event/delete` - Delete event

## Test Cases
- Delete existing event succeeds
- Delete non-existent event returns error
- Soft delete preserves data
- Hard delete removes completely
- Cascade effects handled properly

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Event ID parameter validation implemented
- [ ] Soft delete vs hard delete options
