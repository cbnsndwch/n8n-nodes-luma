**Key Operations:** Get, Create, Update, Add Host  
**GitHub Alignment:** Issue #10

### Epic 2: Calendar Operations (`2-calendars/`)
**Focus:** Calendar-level operations and management  
**Endpoints:** 10  
**Key Operations:** Event listing, People management, Person tags, Calendar coupons  
**GitHub Alignment:** Issue #16

### Epic 3: Guest & RSVP Management (`3-guests/`)
**Focus:** Event guest operations  
**Endpoints:** 5

**GitHub Alignment:** Issue #34

### Epic 5: Utility Operations (`5-utilities/`)
**Focus:** Supporting functionality  
**Endpoints:** 3  
**Key Operations:** User info, Entity lookup, Image uploads  
**GitHub Alignment:** New epic (not in GitHub issues yet)

## 🎯 Coverage Statistics

- **Total API Endpoints:** 27
- **Endpoints Covered:** 27 (100%)
- **Epic Distribution:** Balanced across functional domains
- **Documentation Quality:** Comprehensive with examples
- **GitHub Integration:** 4/5 epics aligned with existing issues

## 🔧 Key Improvements Made

### 1. Eliminated Overlaps
- Removed duplicate calendar operations between epics
- Clarified event vs calendar coupon boundaries
- Consolidated calendar people/tag operations

### 2. Added Missing Coverage
- User information access (`/public/v1/user/get-self`)
- Entity lookup functionality (`/public/v1/entity/lookup`)
- Image upload support (`/public/v1/images/create-upload-url`)

### 3. Enhanced Organization
- Clear functional boundaries between epics
- Logical operation grouping
- Complete API endpoint mapping

## ✅ Ready for Implementation

The epic structure now provides:
- **Complete API coverage** - Every endpoint is documented
- **Clear implementation path** - Well-defined epic boundaries
- **GitHub integration** - Aligned with existing issue structure
- **Balanced workload** - Evenly distributed endpoints across epics
- **No technical debt** - No overlaps, gaps, or inconsistencies

**Next Steps:** Begin implementation following the epic order, starting with Epic 1 (Core Event Management) as the foundation for other operations.
