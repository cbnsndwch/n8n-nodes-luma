## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checklist
- [x] All 27 OpenAPI endpoints are mapped
- [x] No endpoint appears in multiple epics
- [x] No endpoint is missing from epic coverage
- [x] Epic groupings follow logical functional domains
- [x] GitHub issue alignment maintained for first 4 epics
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

### Coverage Verification
This analysis was generated by:
1. Extracting all endpoints from `docs/luma.openapi.yml`
2. Mapping each endpoint to its corresponding epic
3. Verifying no overlaps or gaps exist
4. Confirming logical functional grouping
