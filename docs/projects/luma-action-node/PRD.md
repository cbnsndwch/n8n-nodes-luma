# Luma Action Node - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This PRD defines the implementation requirements for a comprehensive Luma Action Node for n8n, enabling users to perform CRUD operations and manage events, guests, calendars, and related resources through Luma's API.

## Current State

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Basic Luma node scaffold with placeholder functionality
- Comprehensive Luma Trigger node for polling-based workflows  
- API credentials configuration
- Build system and project structure

## Target State

üìã **To Be Implemented:**
- Full-featured Luma Action Node with complete API coverage
- Support for all major Luma resources (Events, Calendars, Guests, etc.)
- CRUD operations following n8n best practices
- Error handling and validation
- Documentation and examples

## API Coverage Analysis

Based on Luma's API structure (`/v{version}/{resource}/{action}`), the action node should support:

### Core Resources
1. **Events** - Primary resource for event management
2. **Calendars** - Container and organization management
3. **Guests** - Attendee and registration management  
4. **Tickets** - Ticket types and pricing management
5. **Coupons** - Discount and promotion management
6. **People** - Contact and attendee data management
7. **User** - Account and profile management

### Core Operations
- **List** - Get multiple resources with filtering
- **Get** - Retrieve single resource by ID
- **Create** - Add new resources
- **Update** - Modify existing resources  
- **Delete** - Remove resources

## Epic Structure

The implementation is organized into 7 main epics, each focusing on a specific resource area:

1. **Epic 1: Core Event Management** (`1-events/epic.md`)
2. **Epic 2: Calendar Operations** (`2-calendars/epic.md`)  
3. **Epic 3: Guest & RSVP Management** (`3-guests/epic.md`)
4. **Epic 4: Ticket Management** (`4-tickets/epic.md`)
5. **Epic 5: Coupon & Promotion Management** (`5-coupons/epic.md`)
6. **Epic 6: People & Contact Management** (`6-people/epic.md`)
7. **Epic 7: User & Account Operations** (`7-users/epic.md`)

## Implementation Principles

### n8n Node Patterns
- **Resource/Operation Pattern**: Following established n8n conventions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant fields based on selection
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper error handling
- **Validation**: Input validation and API response handling

### API Integration Patterns  
- **RESTful Operations**: Support for GET/POST operations as per Luma conventions
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of rate limits, validation errors, and API failures
- **Pagination**: Support for paginated responses where applicable
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management

### User Experience Patterns
- **Intuitive Flow**: Logical grouping of operations by resource
- **Clear Labeling**: Descriptive names and help text
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for both simple and advanced use cases
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Complete API surface coverage

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ All major Luma API endpoints are accessible
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and validation  
- ‚úÖ Follows n8n community node standards
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ Performance: Efficient API calls with proper caching
- ‚úÖ Reliability: Robust error handling and retry logic
- ‚úÖ Maintainability: Clean, well-documented code structure
- ‚úÖ Usability: Intuitive user interface following n8n patterns

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- Luma Plus subscription (API access requirement)
- Valid Luma API key
- n8n workflow environment
- Existing credential configuration

### API Constraints
- Rate limiting considerations
- Per-route versioning (v1, v2 endpoints)
- POST-based write operations
- JSON request/response format

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **API Changes**: Luma's evolving API with per-route versioning
2. **Rate Limiting**: Potential throttling with high-volume operations
3. **Complex Data Models**: Rich event/guest data structures

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Version Management**: Support multiple API versions per endpoint
2. **Rate Limit Handling**: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input/output validation

## Timeline & Delivery

### Implementation Order (Recommended)
1. **Epic 1: Core Event Management** - Foundation operations
2. **Epic 3: Guest & RSVP Management** - High-value user scenarios  
3. **Epic 2: Calendar Operations** - Organizational features
4. **Epic 4: Ticket Management** - Monetization features
5. **Epic 5: Coupon Management** - Marketing features
6. **Epic 6: People Management** - Advanced CRM features
7. **Epic 7: User Operations** - Administrative features

### Delivery Strategy
- Each epic can be implemented and tested independently
- Core functionality (Events + Guests) provides immediate value
- Advanced features can be added incrementally
- Parallel development possible for different epics

## Next Steps

1. üìñ **Review Epic Documentation**: Start with `1-events/epic.md`
2. üèóÔ∏è **Implementation**: Begin with core event operations
3. üß™ **Testing**: Validate against live Luma API endpoints
4. üìö **Documentation**: Update README and usage examples
5. üöÄ **Release**: Package and publish to npm registry
