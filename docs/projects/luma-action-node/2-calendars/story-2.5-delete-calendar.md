# [PROJ_002] Story 2.5: Delete Calendar

## User Story
**As a** workflow developer  
**I want to** remove calendars that are no longer needed  
**So that** I can maintain clean organization structures

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Support calendar ID identification
- ✅ Handle cascading effects (events, people, etc.)
- ✅ Confirm deletion with success response
- ✅ Support archive vs permanent delete

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Resource: Calendar
// Operation: Delete
// Parameters:
{
  calendarId: string (required),
  additionalFields: {
    archive?: boolean, // archive instead of delete
    transferEvents?: boolean, // transfer events to another calendar
    transferToCalendarId?: string
  }
}
```

## Test Cases
- Delete empty calendar succeeds
- Delete calendar with events (with/without transfer)
- Archive calendar preserves data
- Transfer events to another calendar
- Non-existent calendar returns error

## API Endpoint
- `POST /v1/calendar/delete`
